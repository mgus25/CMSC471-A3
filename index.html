    <h1>Assignment 3: White Hat/Black Hat Visualization</h1>

    <h2>Black Hat Visulization</h3>
    <div id="vis-black-hat"></div>
    <div id="toggle-buttons">
        <button id="btn-race">By Race</button>
        <button id="btn-gender">By Gender</button>
    </div>    
    <p>
        This visualization shows the number of complaints filed against police officers. The graph provides insight 
        into how these complaints break down by officer demographics. The first view of the graph shows complaints 
        by officer race, while the second view shows complaints by officer gender. This is a black hat visualization, 
        so the goal during the design process was to give a false impression regarding which demographics receive 
        the most complaints. Two techniques were utilized to achieve this effect:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Labels: Axis manipulation</li>
        <li>Encoding: Color choice</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You will notice that the y-axis is actually flipped. This means the maximum number of complaints appears at 
        the bottom of the graph, while zero complaints is at the top. This results in more complaints being 
        represented with small bar lines and fewer complaints being represented with large bar lines. This is 
        counterintuitive and contrary to bar chart norms, meaning the viewer may reach a false conclusion about 
        the data unless they inspect the y-axis values. The second misleading component is the color encoding. 
        We commonly associate green with "good" and red with "bad." In the visualization, the highest number of 
        complaints is shown in green while the lowest number of complaints is shown in red. This is contrary to 
        common color conventions and reinforces the faulty perception implied by the previous manipulation.
